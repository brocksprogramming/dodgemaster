dodgemaster
===========

a simple game in jquery

// This is just a simple game I made in Jquery, CSS, and HTML.
// You may add on to this game if you'd like as long as you give credit to Brock Lynch.
// To use this simply dump the contents of the repository into a folder or local server and run the index.html or dodgemaster.html.
The goal of this game is to make it past the obstacles, which so far are the killer robots shooting fireballs, and then you have to answer the easy riddle.
